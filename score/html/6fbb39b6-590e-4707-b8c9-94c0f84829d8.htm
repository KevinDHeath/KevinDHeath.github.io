            Stonehigh (5), Euphoria (1), Lust Conquers All (2) Grab a Snack, (2), Catch a Buzz (2),
            Sold Out (4), Double Crossed (3), Utterly Wiped Out (1), Steal Your Neighbor's Pot (4), Banker (1).
            <br /><br /></p></li><li><p>Shuffle the remainder of the deck <strong>thoroughly</strong> and deal:<br />
            Dealer begins with player to his left, deals six cards to each player (minimum of two players,
            maximum of six). Place the remaining cards face down in a pile called the <span class="literal">Grass Stack</span>.
            <br /><br /></p></li><li><p>Examine your hand:<br />The objective of the game is to put down as many <strong>Peddle</strong>
            cards (cards with dollar amounts on them) with as high a total as you can.<br />
            Before you can place Peddle cards down on the table (creating your <span class="literal">Stash Pile</span>)
            you must have a <strong>Market Open</strong> card to begin with (which creates your <span class="literal">Hassle Pile</span>
            when played in front of you).<br />
            Player to the dealer's left begins by drawing a card from the <span class="literal">Grass Stack</span>
            (he now holds seven cards in his hand) and playing a card (if he has a Market Open card played in front to begin
            his <span class="literal">Hassle Pile</span> or discarding into the <span class="literal">Wasted Pile</span>
            (next to the <span class="literal">Grass Stack</span>).<br />
            At the end of a turn you can not have more or less then six cards in your hand.<br />
            You can not draw from the <span class="literal">Wasted Pile</span>.
            <br /><br /></p></li><li><p>Play until one player can open his <span class="literal">Hassle Pile</span> with a Market Open card.<br />
            Once you've put down a Market Open card you must wait for your next turn to put down a Peddle (money)
            card.<br />
            Any other player may stop you from tabling a Peddle card - even if the other player hasn't yet opened
            with a Market Open card - by playing a <strong>Heat On</strong> card on your Market Open card.<br />
            You do not have to discard if you have played a card and only six cards remain in your hand.
            <br /><br /></p></li><li><p>How to reopen after Market Open card has been covered:<br />
            To be able to again put down Peddle cards the player with a Heat On card covering his Market Open card
            must wait for a <strong>Heat Off</strong> card that <em>corresponds</em> with the Heat On card (these are four
            varieties). Then move the Market Open card back to the top of the pile.<br />
            bitmap<br />
            Or you may reopen with a <strong>Pay Fine/Heat Off</strong> card, <em>if</em> you already have Peddle cards down.
            Place the Pay Fine/Heat Off card on your <span class="literal">Hassle Pile</span> and pay a fine of your
            smallest tabled Peddle card to the <span class="literal">Wasted Pile</span> (discard). Then move the
            Market Open card back to the top of the pile.<br />
            You need only one Market Open card at this time so if you receive others you may safely discard them.<br />
            You may not reopen a <span class="literal">Hassle Pile</span> with a Market Open card.
            <br /><br /></p></li><li><p>How each hand ends:<br />
            When any player puts a <strong>Market Close</strong> card on top of his <span class="literal">Hassle Pile</span>
            - which must be started and which cannot have a Heat On card on top of it - the hand ends.<br />
            Or it ends automatically when the <span class="literal">Grass Stack</span> dwindles to nothing.
            <br /><br /></p></li><li><p>How to score a hand:<br />
            Each player totals the Peddle Money in his <span class="literal">Stash Pile</span> (on the table) and
            subtracts the amount of the highest single Peddle card still held in his hand.<br />
            A $25,000 bonus goes to the player with the highest score for that hand.
