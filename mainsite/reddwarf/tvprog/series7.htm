      <dd>The crew's altercation with their future selves has left the timelines in a flux. All of
        the curry and lager supplies were destroyed, leaving Lister distraught. As they are at the
        point before they discovered the Time Drive (but for some reason retain memories of it),
        Lister suggests they go back, pick up the Time Drive, go back in time, and place a huge
        carry-out order for 500 curries. Kryten of course nixes that--any action they might take
        in the past would have trillions of implications. Besides which, there is also the
        possibility of becoming their hedonistic future selves (see <a href="series6.htm#Out">Out
        of Time</a> for details). However Lister, intent on getting curries, steals Kryten's body
        while his head is emptying itself of unneeded files. He replaces Kryten's head with Spare
        Head Two, and, after removing his guilt chip and behavior protocols, talks him into giving
        the OK for a 23rd century curry hunt.<p>So the crew heads back to the derelict and takes
        the Time Drive--but strangely-acting Spare Head Two, unfamiliar with the Drive (which now
        resembles the matter transporter from <a href="series4.htm#Meltdown">Meltdown</a> in both
        appearance and ability to transverse space, which the original Time Drive was unable to
        do) accidentally takes the crew back to the fifth floor of a book depository in Dallas,
        Texas on November 22, 1963: just in time to foil Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of
        President Kennedy. When they are caught by police, Kryten prods them forward three years.
        The city is now deserted. After reading a newspaper, Kryten explains what happened:
        Kennedy was impeached in 1964 for sharing a mistress with a Mob boss, and J. Edgar Hoover
        was elected as president. Hoover was controlled by the Mafia and, in return for cocaine
        trafficking, allowed Cuba to build a nuclear missile base. Terrified, people fled from
        major cities. Kryten also discovers that Starbug no longer exists--he postulates that the
        United States' internal troubles allowed Russia to win the Space Race. Not only that, but
        the Time Drive is frozen and they are stuck! Lister fesses up to Cat and Rimmer, and they
        are less than pleased--but they still need to find a way to fix things.</p>
        <p>After the Time Drive unfroze itself, the crew goes back to 1963 and trick Oswald into
        shooting from the sixth floor: but that makes the shot too steep, and Oswald misses. Then
        Lister has a brilliant plan--if they could get a second gunman to shoot from behind the
        grassy knoll, the shot would be perfect. So Lister takes the Time Drive to Idlewild
        Airport 1965 and talks former President Kennedy into assassinating himself for the good of
        the nation and his reputation. So behind the grassy knoll, in a police officer's uniform,
        drinking a bottle of Coke, John Fitzgerald Kennedy takes a high-powered rifle, fires, and
        disappears into oblivion...setting the United States on its former path, and insuring his
        reputation throughout history.</p>

      <dd>After a daring but dangerously close rescue, Ace Rimmer takes refuge in our Dwarf's
        dimension. Getting Rimmer alone, he tells Rimmer that he, Ace Rimmer, is dying, and wants
        Arnie to take his place. He is not the original Ace Rimmer. He is a hard-light hologram,
        just like Arnie. His light bee was irrevocably damaged and he is on his way out. Ace
        explains to Arnie that as each Ace dies, he recruits his replacement from a nearby
        dimension, because the universe needs a hero. Rimmer refuses, believing himself not good
        enough. Ace confides in Lister, hoping Lister can convince Arnie to undertake his Ace
        training--Ace has only 12 hours or so left before he dies. Arnie agrees.<p>The training is
        terribly difficult, and Arnie becomes discouraged. Finally Ace tells him that if he can
        convince his crewmates he is really Ace, he will know he is ready. Using a light-bee
        remote, he changes Arnie's clothes and removes the &quot;H&quot;. He pulls off his wig and
        hands it to Arnie, along with his glasses. So Arnie wanders around the ship, trying to get
        into character without letting anyone know he is not really Ace. But out of the AR suite
        steps a man in armor from one of Lister's role-playing simulations, challenging Arnie to a
        duel. Arnie fights, grabs a bazookoid, and blasts him. He is so thrilled he had the
        courage to stand up to and kill the knight, he runs away happily. When he leaves, the
        knight stands up, removes the blank cartridges from the bazookoid, replaces it with a live
        cartridge, and takes off his helmet to reveal...Lister.</p>
        <p>Arnie, running to tell Ace the good news, gets there just in time to say his goodbyes
        to our hero. Ace disappears and dies. The other crew members run in to find a man dressed
        as Ace sitting at Rimmer's bunk, with a dead light bee lying on the bed. Lister explains
        that Arnie was killed by a knight escaping from the AR machine. So Cat and Kryten are led
        to believe that Rimmer is dead, and this man is actually Ace Rimmer. The Dwarfers hold a
        eulogy and funeral for Rimmer, bestowing upon him the rank of &quot;First Officer.&quot;
        They follow the beacon Ace left behind for his coffin, which leads to the resting place of
        all the other Ace Rimmers. Lister and Arnie discover that there have been so many Aces the
        number of coffins have formed a large ring around a planet. Convinced of his destiny,
        Arnie says his goodbyes and takes off in the Dimension Jumper for adventure...</p>

      <dd>The episode opens in the Aigburth Arms pub, Liverpool. A box with the word
        &quot;Oroboros&quot; written on the side is pushed underneath one of the pool tables. It
        is found by a customer, and contains a baby. He is fussed over by the customer and a
        barmaid, and they wonder what will become of him...<p>Back on Starbug, three million and
        change years into the future, Lister is pulling out nose hairs with a pair of salad tongs.
        This causes him to sneeze so violently he loses a tooth cap, which Kryten glues back on
        temporarily with wood glue (at Lister's insistence) Krtyen then gives Lister a pair of
        fuzzy bunny slippers and a frilly pink dressing-gown he found to try on before he makes
        the necessary alterations. Lister then manages to get a box of dental floss attached to
        his face, thanks to the not-yet-dry wood glue. Just then, Cat runs in with news--there's
        some sort of thing out in space. That something turns out to be a rip in the fabric of
        space-time. Entering into it, Cat, Kryten, and Lister come upon...alternate versions of
        themselves...except Lister is a hologram! Our Lister learns that in this alternate
        dimension, he was wiped out in the radiation leak that killed the others, because
        Kochanski took the blame for Frankenstein, Lister's pet cat. So Kochanski was put into
        stasis, not Dave, which meant...</p>
        <p>Kochanski is still alive. She walks into the temporal rift and greets our Dave, who is
        certainly blown away. The two crews agree to exchange supplies, but Kochanski has a
        special request of Lister. She asks him for a sperm sample so she can have children
        someday. She and her Dave were together at last, and in love. As she hands Lister the
        in-vitro tube that contains her contribution, there is an explosion and temporal rift
        begins to collapse! Kryten realizes through that handy psi-scan of his that GELFs are
        attacking them! Kochanski falls into a rip of non-space, and is saved only by grabbing
        onto the dental floss still attached to Lister's face, and is carried to the wrong
        Starbug...</p>
        <p>Kochanski wakes up in the Medibay, and, after realizing she is snogging the wrong
        Lister, immediately gets up and sets to work rescuing Starbug from the attacking GELFs. It
        turns out Lister's GELF bride from <a href="series6.htm#Emohawk" ;>Polymorph: Emohawk II</a>
        is still chasing after him. Using some fancy manuevers, Kochanski gets them away and, with
        the help of a terribly jealous Kryten (he is terrified she will take Lister away from
        him), sets up a new linkway with her universe. Lister gives her the filled in-vitro tube,
        and says goodbye. She hands him a phone that might be able to communicate
        trans-dimensional, promises to tell the baby all about him, and leaves.</p>
        <p>Back on our Starbug, the crew starts to unpack the supplies from Kochanski's ship. One
        of the boxes has a picture of a snake eating its own tail. Kryten explains that that is a
        symbol for infinity, and it is called Oroboros. Lister starts! He realizes that the baby
        he and Kochanski and have will be him, and they will go back in time and leave him under
        the pool table, so that humanity can never end. As long as Lister is alive, the human race
        will continue for all eternity. They must have written &quot;oroboros&quot; on the box to
        explain! Lister runs after Kochanski to get the tube, but they are again attacked by the
        GELFs and the timeway rips, leaving Kochanski on the wrong side again! Determined not to
        be left behind, she takes a running start, and leaps for her own dimension...to miss by
        inches as it whorls away. As she falls into infinity, she contacts Lister via the
        inter-dimensional communicator and says she'll stay if he'll save her life. So he grabs a
        crossbow and some rope from Starbug, shoots her in the leg (by accident), and hauls her
        up. She comes to in the medibay, and immediately gets up to start re-establishing the
        linkway.</p>
        <p>Back at the Aigburth Arms, Lister appears carrying a box with the word
        &quot;Oroboros&quot; written on the side. Lister says goodbye to himself, and pushes the
        box under the pool table...</p>

      <dd>Kochanski is not having an easy time of adjusting to her new home. The thermo settings
        are wild, there's no cottage cheese with pinapple chunks in, there are sneakers in the
        fridge, no bathtubs, and the noisy pipes in her room &quot;squelukal&quot; when they
        should &quot;nureeek&quot;. And Kryten is less than sympathetic--even after he
        accidentally shrinks her only set of spare clothes. But Lister is determined to help--he
        creates a makeshift bathtub, gives her a present of clothing and makeup he found in a
        derelict, and gives her his quarters for the night until they can fix the pipes in hers.
        When Kryten finds out, he has a flash of insight--Lister will abandon him for Kochanski if
        he doesn't put a stop to their relationship right now! So he blames Lister for Kochanski's
        shrunken uniform. That doesn't phase her--all she wants is a bath and some sleep. Kryten
        stalks out, and Lister takes his leave--and then there is an explosion and the ship rocks!
        Kryten rushes in and says that something overloaded when he tried to adjust the
        thermo-settings. The backup power kicks in, flickers, and dies. The ship is dead, the
        doors are locked down, and they are simply floating through space. They have to re-fire
        the backup generator, but in order to do so they must crawl through miles of service
        ducts. So they climb into Lister's shower and begin finding their way...<p>Until Lister
        has an attack of claustrophobia. Kochanski and Cat take turns trying to distract him while
        they find a room to drop into. While Kochanski and Kryten attempt to unscrew one of the
        vents, Cat beings to hear a watery kind of roaring noise. Lister realizes that every four
        hours the recyc water floods the vents--and its time! He and Cat scramble, and manage to
        hide before they are pummeled. That is, until the drying vents take over and blow Cat and
        Lister down the vent into Kochanski and Cat, who have found a supply room to drop into.
        They give Lister a sedative, and head on...</p>
        <p>The crew notice that it is getting hotter, not colder as it should be if all the power
        was out and the heaters weren't working. Well, as it turns out, Starbug must have been
        jogged off course and is now heading into a nearby star. Kryten is overtaken by guilt and
        explains this is all his fault--he adjusted the thermo settings to overload to keep
        Kochanski from having a bath and eventually taking Lister away from him! Of course, nobody
        was very happy. So to cut down on time, the gang waits until water recyc hits again, and
        ride the wave of water down the duct into the engine room, drop down, and realize they are
        in Lister's quarters! Kryten turned the map upside down halfway through the trip! When all
        hope seems lost, and Starbug has almost reached the star, Kryten guiltily informs them
        that he'd excluded the doors from the shutdown...just in case. So they'd been crawling
        through the vents all night for no reason whatsoever! A disgruntled Lister and Cat race
        into the cockpit, leaving Kochanski and a heavy metal spanner alone with Kryten...</p>

      <dd>This is the second funniest Red Dwarf episode ever, after <a href="series2.htm#Parallel">Parallel
        Universe</a>!<p>Kryten is becoming more and more annoyed with Miss Kochanski. Not only has
        all of her frilly underthings created a huge extra washload, not only does she dry her
        tights on the radiator, NOT ONLY does he have to learn all sorts of new female
        terminology, but, after all the months Kryten spent training the crew to put the salad
        cream (Americans, read: salad dressing) back in the fridge, it is all of a sudden winding
        up in the cupboard again! Fortunately, she managed to get another linkway to her
        dimension, so she will be gone the next day. Lister is more than a little disappointed, of
        course. He will miss her.</p>
        <p>While heading towards the linkway, directly in Starbug's path is a comet. Rather than
        go around the comet (the safe and sensible thing to do) Lister decides to take Starbug
        THROUGH it, which nearly tears the ship to pieces and prevents Kochanski from getting to
        the linkway in time. According to the computer, the thrusters didn't work properly because
        the ship is too heavy, so Lister and Cat (whom Lister mistakenly calls &quot;Rimmer&quot;)
        head down to the cargo decks to see what they can jettison. But when we get down there,
        Lister won't allow any of Rimmer's old belongings to be thrown out--they have too many
        fond memories attached to them. Golf games, the Locker Room game, even Rimmer's shoe trees
        make Lister smile. Cat is of course confused beyond belief--Rimmer was nothing but a
        cowardly nuisance!</p>
        <p>Later that day, while he is alone in Starbug's cockpit, Lister is surprised when Rimmer
        materializes! He tells Lister how much he misses him...and starts asking about Kochanski.
        Lister informs him that Kochanski is &quot;all right&quot;, but she's nothing compared to
        Rimmer. Overcome by emotion, Lister and Rimmer fall into each other's arms, and, after
        whispering each other's name lovingly, look deep into each others' eyes, and kiss
        passionately...</p>
        <p>Until Lister, with a scream, falls out of his bunk! He'd been having a dream.
        Distraught, he seeks Kryten's help. Kryten suggests hypnotherapy. As he leaves for the
        correct program, Kochanski walks in, and, after letting Lister express his feelings and
        talking to him sensibly, helps Lister feel better. Of course Kryten is mad Lister doesn't
        need his help anymore, so he comes up with a cunning plan...</p>
        <p>Calling the others into the AR suite, Krtyen runs a program designed to call attention
        to each and every one of Rimmer's quirks, annoying habits, and self-centered actions. It
        is a celebration of everything Rimmer, including a full song-and-dance number by Munchkin
        Rimmers! By the end, Lister has no desire to think fondly upon Rimmer again.</p>

      <dd>Kochanski is certainly not anywhere near Kryten's good side. Rather than partake of his
        celebratory anniversary dinner, complete with lobster, Cat and Lister join Kochanski in
        the AR simulation of &quot;Jane Austin World&quot;. He's so annoyed he tries to take out
        each of the Bennett sisters in &quot;Pride and Prejudice Land&quot; so the boys will
        leave; when that doesn't work, he borrows a tank from the WWII game and blows Mr.
        Bingley's gazebo (and Mrs. Bennett) out of the water!<p>So the crew sits down to eat
        Kryten's overcooked anniversary dinner. Which, although tense, might have been passable,
        had Lister not asked for ketchup to go with his lobster. Kryten is so enraged by Lister's
        request, his head explodes! So Lister and Kochanski get one of Kryten's spare heads, and
        that explodes too. So does every spare head Kryten has. They are only able to save his RAM
        chips, so his memory is intact. The crew logs onto the Divadroid mainframe to try to
        locate a spare head. Fortunately they do. But when they get to the derelict, they find it
        is inhabited by rogue Simulants! And although the heads they find are intact, they have no
        primers, so the heads themselves are useless. Then Kochanski has a brilliant idea.</p>
        <p>Kochanski and Cat get back to Starbug and dress up in GELF suits--for although
        Simulants hate humanoids, they don't hate GELFs! Posing as a GELF couple, Kochanksi and
        Cat take Lister on board the Simulant-infested vessel as their property. They strike a
        deal with the Sim (after Cat slips up and starts talking human language rather than the
        GELF language they were approximating): he'll flip a coin. Tails, they get the heads and
        primers, heads, he keeps Lister. Fortunately he flips tails, and, after drinking a toast
        to the Simulants, gives the crew the mech heads and primers.</p>
        <p>But when they get back to Starbug, the crew finds their ship ransacked--and worse,
        Kryten's body is missing! Now they have to find a way to rescue Kryten's body and RAM
        chips...</p>
        <p>On board the Simulant vessel, a mech that looks a lot like Kryten but with the IQ of a
        glass of water is given Kryten's body to repair. Once Kryten is given a head and
        reinstated, we learn that the Mech (named Abel) has the same motherboard as our
        Kryten--they are brothers, more or less. However, Abel is addicted to the chemical
        Ultrazone, which is highly addictive and corrupts mech's circuitboards. Kryten is not
        happy.</p>
        <p>Back on board Starbug, the remaining crew learns that the Sim ship can travel a lot
        faster than they, and Starbug has no chance of catching up. But Kochanski has a plan. She
        tricks the Sims into believing they planted a bomb on board. The Sim, a GELF, Abel, and
        Kryten beam on board.</p>

      <dd>In a vain attempt to cheer up the one-armed Lister, his crew mates try to list all the
        famous one-armed figures, but fail miserably. Kryten builds Lister an artificial arm, but
        it would take him a whole morning to lift one ball! A ray of light is offered when
        Christine suggests using Krytens' &quot;nanobots&quot; - microscopic robots that
        mechanoids have as a self-repair system - could reengineer an arm for Lister.
        Unfortunately, Kryten lost his after the incident on the Esperanto, but Lister will not
        give up hope and sets a course back to the water world. Before reaching this planet,
        Starbug encounters a strange planetoid, which according to the scanners is Red Dwarf!
        Could it really be - of course not! They do recover some objects, including a remote link
        with Holly. The senile computer begins to tell the chilling tale of how the nanobots
        mutineered, took over Red Dwarf and recreated it in a size more appropriate for them - a
        microscopic Red Dwarf. A Red Dwarf so small it could hide anywhere - including Lister's
        laundry basket!<p><b>Episode Quote</b>: &quot;Unbelievable. Dumped on a planet in the
        middle of an electro-storm and left to rot for hundreds of years, and the guy's lost
        nothing.&quot;</p>
