      <dd>The premiere episode. All of the necessary components are established: we learn that
        Lister is a slob, Rimmer hates Astronavigation Exams, and that there's a cat wandering the
        air ducts on board the ship. We also meet Lister's love Kristine Kochanski for the first
        time, and hear about his plan to buy a farm on Fiji, get a sheep and a cow, and breed
        horses. Alas! Captain Holister discovers that Lister has been hiding Frankenstein the
        (pregnant!) cat and orders Lister into stasis when he won't give her up. When Lister
        revives, it is three million years later. The crew was killed by a radiation leak, leaving
        Lister companionless with the exception of a dead Rimmer (brought back by Holly, the
        ship's computer, as a hologram) and a creature that evolved from Frankenstein's kittens.
        Now, if they could only figure out a way to get home...<p><b>Episode Quote:</b> &quot;I'm
        not an insubordinate man by nature. I try to respect Rimmer, but it's not easy because
        he's such a SMEGHEAD!&quot;</p>

      <dd>Strange things start to happen when The Dwarf suddenly hits light speed. The crew starts
        seeing bits of the future: the Cat breaks his tooth, a picture of Lister with two babies,
        Lister age 171. Then Rimmer seeing Lister die while working with the Navvy-comp! Lister
        tries to change the future...right until Holly calls him up to the Drive Room--the
        Navvy-comp's overheating and needs to be disconnected manually...<p><b>Episode Quote:</b>

      <dd>Lister is finally getting sick of Rimmer lording his superior rank of 2nd Technician
        over him: Rimmer has hidden Lister's cigarettes, and will give Lister only one cigarette
        for each day Lister obeys him; Lister asks Rimmer if he can run Kochanski's hologram for
        only four hours so he can go out on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses. So Lister decides
        to take matters into his own hands and pass the Chef's exam, making him an officer. Rimmer
        of course tries to prevent this (the extremes he goes to include switching his physical
        disk with Kochanski's, giving him her form housing his mind and trying to convince Lister
        to throw in the towel. Lister of course sees through this). Lister finishes the exam and
        goes to get his score, Rimmer waiting impatiently over his shoulder...<p><b>Episode Quote:</b>

      <dd>Cat is kind enough to furnish Lister with some old Cat books to smell in his spare
        time--including the Cat Bible, which explains the origins of his race. When Holly
        translates the Bible, Lister learns that his act of saving Frankenstein (The Holy Mother)
        has made him the Cat's God. His idea of going to Fiji and opening a donut and sausage
        diner shop has become the Cat's image of heaven.<p>In the meantime, The Dwarf has picked
        up a strange-looking pod. Rimmer studies it (from a safe distance, of course) and decides
        that it belongs to an alien race called the &quot;Quagaars.&quot; He waits impatiently for
        the pod's quarantine period to be up so he can open it and inspect its contents...</p>
        <p>Reading through the Cat Bible, Lister finds that there was thousands of years of holy
        wars over whether the donut diner hats on Fushal (the Cat's interpretation of Fiji) were
        to be red or blue. Most of the Cats were killed fighting about it...the rest loaded
        themselves onto arks and flew off in search of the Promised Land, with Lister's laundry
        list to guide them. (The Cats thought it was a star chart.) Lister, revolted by the idea
        of being a religious icon, finds he must play the part of God to a blind Cat priest found
        dying in the bowels of the Dwarf....</p>

      <dd>Lister sojourns up to the officer's quarters to check out Kochanski's effects and dream
        recorder. (She dreamt about him three times, incidentally.) What he didn't know was that
        those quarters hadn't been decontaminated. Lister comes down with a bad case of mutated
        pneumonia. This pneumonia makes any hallucinations Lister has &quot;solid.&quot; After
        the mayor of Warsaw spontaneously combusts in the corridor and fish begin raining from the
        ceiling of Lister's quarters, Lister hallucinated two men in the drive room: his
        Confidence and his Paranoia.<p>Rimmer realizes that Lister won't be better until both
        Confidence and Paranoia are gone; prying Lister away from Confidence, however, is
        extremely difficult. Confidence keeps complimenting Lister, telling him how wonderful he
        is...and helping him figure out where Rimmer hid Kochanski's hologrammic disk. Paranoia,
        on the other hand, has been moping around the drive room. Moping, that is, until the
        medical unit (which is supposed to be healing Lister) is found smashed, and Paranoia is
        nowhere to be found...</p>

      <dd>In the last episode when Lister (aided by Confidence) recovered the cache of hologrammic
        disks Rimmer had hidden, Lister loaded up Kochanski's disk; to his dismay, Rimmer had
        switched Kochanski's disk with his own! Now there are two Rimmers running around Red
        Dwarf.<p>Rimmer and Rimmer move in together into the quarters next door to Lister's. While
        helping him move, Lister happens upon a copy of Rimmer's death video. He views it in
        secret and learns that for some reason Rimmer's last words are &quot;gazpacho soup.&quot;
        This puzzles him mightily; especially after our Rimmer refuses to reveal his secret.</p>
        <p>The new Rimmer has taken it upon himself to drive the old Rimmer to succeed.
        Eventually, though, Rimmer being who he is, they get into a fight; it escalates to the
        point where Lister gets fed up enough to shut one of them off. With a few lines of
        &quot;Ippy Dippy My Spaceshippy&quot; the original Rimmer is chosen for wiping. (The new
        Rimmer, of course, is thrilled and lords it over the other.) Our Rimmer, therefore, in
        full dress uniform, reports to the Drive Room to be wiped. Before he goes, though, he
        agrees to explain all about &quot;gazpacho soup,&quot; only to learn that Lister has
        tricked him into revealing the &quot;gazpacho soup&quot; secret...the other Rimmer was
        already wiped!</p>
