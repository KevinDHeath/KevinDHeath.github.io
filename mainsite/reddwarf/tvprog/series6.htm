        <dd><p>Lister wakes up from stasis to learn that Red Dwarf has been stolen by persons or life
          forms unknown. By following the Dwarf's vapor trail in Starbug, Kryten is confident that
          they can recover their lost ship.<p>The Dwarf's trail leads the crew through an asteroid
          belt full of derelict spaceships. The word &quot;Psirens&quot; is scrawled on the floor of
          one of the crafts in blood and intestines. By playing back the black box recording of that
          ship, our boys learn that creatures named Psirens, capable of telepathically changing the
          perception of one's surroundings, lure ships down onto the astroid and suck out the
          crew's brains. The boys must stay strong--one of the methods the Psirens use is seduction.</p>
          <p>After a few failed attempts to get the Dwarfers onto the asteroid, Rimmer leads the
          crew into a giant flaming meteorite, and Starbug crashes. On the asteroid's surface, in
          blasting the ship free with a bazookoid, Lister is nearly seduced and eaten--but is saved
          when the Psirens fight among themselves for his brain.</p>
          <p>Back on the 'Bug, Kryten receives a message from Lister that he is ready to board. But
          as Lister joins the rest of the crew, a second distraught Lister appears, begging for
          entrance! In the interest of safety, Kryten allows the second Lister in--but now there is
          definately a Psiren on board!</p>
          <p>After performing various tests, the crew discover and blast the Psiren--but it escapes
          and hides. Kryten and Rimmer go after it; Rimmer runs away, leaving Kryten to face the
          Psiren alone. But the Psiren takes on the appearance of Kryten's creator--and Kryten is
          programmed to obey her every command, and never to harm her. After ordering Kryten into
          the waste compactor, the Psiren nearly eats Lister and Cat, but is foiled by a very cubist
          Kryten...and the crew continues its search for Red Dwarf.</p>
          <p><b>Episode Quote:</b> &quot;That was merely the level of sophistication required to
          lure the Cat--and it worked. Had we not stopped him, he would now be on one of those
          asteroids, crawling around without a brain, trying to write 'Oh boy, was I suckered!' with
          his own intestinal tract.&quot;</p>

      <dl>
        <dd><p>Starbug is down on supplies--food, water, even movies that Lister doesn't despise. So
          when the ship is enveloped in a strange swirly thing that carries them to a derelict space
          station devoid of life (according to the preliminary psi scan) they are happy to go
          shopping. Although they can't get any details, Kryten learns that this station had
          something to do with classified artificial research--and some of the most brilliant minds
          of the 23rd century.<p>As they board, the psi scan picks up a new life form reading--a
          humanoid wearing a mask who calls himself &quot;Legion&quot;. Legion greets all of the
          Dwarfers by name. He then changes Rimmer's light bee from soft light to hard light--now
          Rimmer can touch things, and is nearly indestructible! After painlessly curing Lister of
          an undetected case of peritonitis, Legion invites the Dwarfers to partake in a Mimosian
          feast that Kryten can share. He leads them to a room filled with artwork and sculptures
          that Legion created himself many years ago--along with the hard-light drive and many other
          inventions.</p>
          <p>Legion is too good to be true--and the Dwarfers agree that they must ask him to join
          their crew. The best way to go about that, they decide, is to trick him into believing
          they are not the uncouth morons they really are. So they put on ridiculous airs and make
          fools of themselves in the process. Finally Rimmer lays it on the line--and Legion refuses
          to join them. However, Legion informs them that they will be his honored guests--for all
          eternity.</p>
          <p>Legion seems intent on keeping the Dwarfers happy--each of them has a &quot;cell&quot;
          tailored to his exact tastes. Lister has a guitar and sugar-puff sandwiches; Rimmer has
          starched pajamas and nocturnal boxing gloves; Kryten has dirty walls and a mop and
          bucket. The food is amazing, and there is a cyberpark in which the crew can interact with
          any persons they choose. They'd be crazy to leave--even so, the Dwarfers do not enjoy
          captivity, and scheme to free themselves. Their plan fails, but they accidentally knock
          off Legion's mask. His face is a composite of all of theirs melded together! Legion
          explains that he is a gestalt entity, a being spawned from their combined minds and
          personalities. He was invented by those scientists from the 23rd century--and while they
          lived, his mind was astonishing, and he was able to create all the artwork and inventions
          within the station. But now, without the Dwarfers inhabiting the station, he is quite
          literally nothing--and will not allow them to leave. But by knocking each of the crew
          members out in turn, Kryten reduces Legion down to one person--him. And since Kryten
          himself cannot endanger the crew, neither can Legion. So Legion helps carry the crew back
          to Starbug, and to freedom.</p>

        <dd><p>Starbug finds its way into Simulant space. Simulants are highly intelligent human-made
          killing machines that hate anything that looks remotely human. Starbug manages to get
          captured by a Simulant ship. The crew is knocked out and, when they awake weeks later,
          find that Starbug has been upgraded in order to play an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse
          with the Simulants. A fluke shot from Starbug destroys the Simulant vessel, but not before
          the Simulants infect Starbug's computers with an &quot;Apocalypse&quot; virus that freezes
          the controls.<p>The crew finds itself plummeting into a planet, when Kryten comes up with
          an idea--he is willing to contract the virus himself and try to work out an antidote
          called a &quot;dove program&quot; before the virus wipes out his core program. Before he
          goes unconscious, Kryten tells the crew to &quot;watch his dreams.&quot;</p>
          <p>Kryten dreams that he is a drunken sheriff in an old Western town. When he is
          confronted with the four Apocalypse boys (Death, War, Pestilence, and Famine), he is told
          he has one hour to clear out of town before he is killed. Kryten of course gives in--he's
          so weak and drunk he can't do anything anymore. Back on Starbug the crew is worried--but
          Lister realizes that they can join Kryten in his dream by hooking him up to the Artificial
          Reality machines. Lister, Cat, and Rimmer choose characters from an Old West Adventure,
          each with a special skill or ability, and ride into town to stop the Apocalypse boys.</p>
          <p>They find Kryten preparing to leave town, giving up all of his possessions for a bottle
          of whiskey. They take Kryten, sober him up, and try to help him remember who he is and
          what he is doing there. Just as Kryten begins to remember, the Apocalypse boys show up to
          run Kryten out of town. To buy Kryten time to complete the dove program, Rimmer challenges
          one of the Apocalypse boys to a one-on-one fistfight (his character's special skill is
          bare-fist fighting). When the crew discovers that their special skills were erased, they
          find themselves on the losing end of the battle. They manage to extract themselves from
          the AR machine, leaving everything up to Kryten--but the extra time the altercation bought
          allowed him to create the dove program, and the ship is saved...</p>

        <dd><p>When Starbug's crew find themselves under arrest by an insane Space Corps enforcement
          probe for looting Space Corp derelict vessels, their only hope is to escape into GELF
          (Genetically Engineered Life Form) space, even though GELFs hate humans and turn them into
          furniture. They crash on one planet and discover that everything that was damaged in the
          robot's attack--except for the oxygen generation unit. They can take off, but Lister and
          Cat could not breathe. So the crew decides to brave a local GELF village and hope they
          will trade for an O/G unit, and not kill them.<p>The local GELFs do in fact have an O/G
          unit to trade--but the chief will only give them the unit in return for Lister marrying
          his daughter. And has his daughter looks like a hairy baboon-nosed water buffalo, Lister
          protests. But the deal goes through and Kryten is given the unit, until Lister, terrified
          at the prospect of a wedding night with his GELF bride, buggers off back to Starbug.
          Furious, the GELFs release an Emohawk (a half-domesticated Polymorph) to chase after the
          crew and drain their emotions. Although they think they escaped, the Dwarf crew find
          themselves aboard Starbug with the Polymorph. Capturing Cat alone, the Emohawk sucks out
          his grace and turns him into...Duane Dibbley! (Although how the Emohawk changed his
          hairstyle and teeth is beyond me. Mayhap it carries around dentures, a salad bowl, and
          scissors?)</p>
          <p>Rimmer runs in, and, discovering Duane and learning of the Emohawk's presence, gets on
          the microphone to warn Lister and Kryten. The microphone turns back into the Emohawk and
          sucks out Rimmer's bitterness. Emerging from Starbug's cockpit is...Ace Rimmer! To save
          Dave and Kryten, he locks them in the Engine Room and decides to open the airlock,
          effectively sucking everything out of the room and killing them--including Cat. But, he
          tells Dave, he'll break Cat's neck first. Before he can do this, Dave and Kryten blast out
          of the engine room, and join Duane and Ace on a hunt for the Emohawk. They take along some
          liquid delinium so they can freeze the Emohawk, extract the stolen emotions, and give them
          back to Cat and Rimmer. The crew finds and freezes the Emohawk, and everything is
          great...until Duane accidentally turns the delinium tank on THEM!</p>

      <dl>
        <dd><p>The Dwarfers come upon the derelict of the Simulant ship they destroyed back in <a href="#Gunmen">Gunmen of the Apocolypse</a>. Because they are low on supplies, and certain
          they destroyed all of the Simulants, the crew risks boarding the unstable ship and
          stealing some of their stores using the still-working teleporter aboard the Simulant ship.
          Of course, right before they are finished, they are interrupted by one of the Simulants.
          She has decided to take them with her into oblivion. However Rimmer, coward he is, manages
          to get into an escape pod, thus distracting the Simulant and allowing his companions to
          escape before the ship explodes. When they try to pick him up, they find that his pod is
          going too fast for them to catch up. In fact he has stowed away on board a seeding ship,
          meant to take settlers to the nearest habitable planet. He will not make planetfall for a
          year and a half. Cat and Lister are, of course, thrilled. Thrilled, that is, until
          Rimmer's ship heads for a wormhole. Now he will reach a planet within a few days, and,
          shortly after, will be found by Starbug. However, due to the time dilation within the
          wormhole, Rimmer will spend 600 years on that planet waiting to be picked up, while it
          will seem less than a week for the crew.<p>The planet Rimmer lands on is a sandy desert
          nearly devoid of life. So he launches eco-accelerator rockets, and, in a week, creates a
          lush green world he names &quot;Rimmerworld&quot;. Lonely, he learns from the ship's books
          that it is possible for him to clone a female companion for himself from his own DNA. But
          when the cocoon the clone has been developing in opens, it is another male version of
          himself. Undaunted, Rimmer tries again...</p>
          <p>By the time Starbug reaches the planet, there are thousands of life readings on
          Rimmer's world! Upon landing, they are arrested by a group of Rimmers! They are taken to
          the leader, who, rather than being hologrammic Rimmer they expected, is flesh and blood.
          They are sentenced to die for neither looking like nor acting like a Rimmer.</p>
          <p>In the prison cell they are taken to, the crew discovers...Rimmer! He tells them that
          he has been in prison for five-hundred and fifty-seven years in his own personal hell--a
          world made up entirely of him. Rimmer explains that those who do not look like Rimmer, or
          who exhibit &quot;unRimmerlike&quot; qualities--bravery, kindness, selflessness--are
          sentenced to death. Using the Simulant teleporter (I don't know how it works if the ship
          was destroyed), the crew leaves the hellhole of Rimmerworld behind.</p>
          <p><b>Episode Quote:</b> &quot;It seemed entirely possible for me to create a fully grown
          female clone, using my own DNA as a template. This of course created the most enormous
          moral dilemma. Technically, she would be my sister, and therefore unable to take me as her
          lover. After much soul searching, I reluctantly decided, 'What the hell', I just wouldn't
          tell her.&quot;</p>

      <dl>
        <dd><p>The crew happens upon a field of &quot;unreality&quot; pockets, which create bubbles of
          fake reality that can endanger or disorient those trying to pass through it. It is a
          defense device used by Space Corps test ships. So the crew decide to navigate it (putting
          Lister, Cat, and Rimmer in stasis so they don't have to endure the unreality), because
          something interesting is bound to be on the other side. A few days later, the boys find a
          Space Corps ship fitted with a drive that can accomplish time travel--a Time Drive. So the
          crew strips it out, install it in Starbug, and discover their problem--the drive goes back
          in time, but it does not transverse space. All they need now is a faster-than-light drive,
          and they can go back to Earth, to any time they choose...<p>Just then, they receive a
          distress signal from...Starbug! It is themselves, 15 years in the future. Their Time Drive
          malfunctioned and they need information from current Starbug to fix it. Kryten agrees to
          help. After sealing the current crew upstairs to prevent them from knowing their future
          (Kryten can wipe his memory, so he can deal with knowing his own future for the time
          being), the future Starbug crew are allowed on board. Our Lister rigs the mediscan up to
          the surveillance cameras so they can see what is going on downstairs. Of course the shock
          is enormous--Yes, all four of them are there, but one of them is nothing more than a
          talking brain in a jar. The future Dwarfers are fat and balding, even hologrammic Rimmer
          (I don't know how that works) But it's when they start talking the anger mounts.
          Apparently the future Dwarfers, equipped with a faster-than-light drive, have become
          epicurists, traveling through time and sampling the pleasures of the various eras.
          However, since the finest things are usually in the possession of the most selfish and evil
          people, the Dwarfers have taken to hobnobbing with folks such as Hitler, Louis XVI, and
          the Goerings. And they enjoy it! Enraged by the hedonistic self-serving pigs they have
          become, Rimmer, Lister, and Cat blast their way downstairs and order their future selves
          off the ship. They leave, but, determined to get the information they need from the
          current Dwarfers' Time Drive, the future crew threaten their past selves with
          annihilation. The future Dwarfers don't care if they die, as long as they don't have to
          spend their remaining days on Starbug. And rather than let their future selves continue
          their lives of selfishness, Rimmer calls for the crew to fight. Future Starbug fires, and
          one by one the crew dies and the ship disintegrate. In a burst of bravery, Rimmer takes a
          bazookoid down to the engine room, and fires at the Time Drive...just as his future self
          fires the last shot to disintegrate Starbug.</p>
