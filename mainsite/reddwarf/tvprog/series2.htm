      <dd>The boys on the Dwarf recieve a distress signal from a mechanoid named Kryten--the ship
        he was on, the Nova 5, had crashed, killing the male members of the crew but sparing the
        three females, and could the Dwarf please bring them medical supplies? The boys are of
        course ecstatic at the prospect of seeing women for the first time in three million years,
        and readily agree. (It is at this point we learn the secret about Arnie's second pair of
        socks.) Rimmer, posing as &quot;Captain A.J. Rimmer, Space Adventurer&quot; leads the crew
        on board the Nova 5, intent on charming the women out of their pants--only to discover (to
        put it bluntly) that Kryten is the android version of Norman Bates, and the women are
        merely skeletons propped up in chairs.<p>Kryten is brought back on board the Dwarf.
        Rimmer, capitalizing on Kryten's slavelike programming, insists on Kryten earning his
        keep. Lister disagrees, and shows Krtyen movies like &quot;The Wild Ones,&quot; and
        &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; in an attempt to make him rebel. Which, of course, he
        finally does. The last time we see Kryten, he's dressed in leather, driving Lister's space
        bike on an exploratory mission in the bowels of the ship, and then to the great beyond...</p>

        'Smeghead.' Or 'Dinosaur Breath' or 'Molecule Mind.' And on a really special occasion when
        you want to be really mega-polite to him, Kryten, we're talking MEGA-polite, in those
        exceptional circumstances, you can call him 'Arse-hole.'&quot;</p>

      <dd>After three million years, the post pod arrives. Rimmer recieves a letter from his mom
        informing him that his father had died. Also in the mail was a copy of the Total Immersion
        Video Game, Better Than Life. Once you are hooked up to BTL, it makes all of your
        innermost desires come true. The boys can't resist, and find themselves in a world of
        their own design--Lister has a vibrating leopard skin waterbed in the shape of a guitar,
        Cat has a wardrobe that crosses an international time zone, and Rimmer--well, Rimmer has
        another liason with Yvonne MacGrouder. Everything is going well until Rimmer's diseased
        brain, unable to cope with nice things happening to him, infects the program...<p><b>Episode

      <dd>At his death-day party, Rimmer gets so drunk as to tell Lister the number of times he
        has made love, and why he is so depressed about it. He agonizes over his lonliness and
        lack of a sex life, and falls asleep crying in his bunk.<br>
        The next morning, the boys discover that mysteriously four days have disappeared and the
        ship's black box is missing. Off they go to find it...it was buried in a grave on a small
        planetoid, amist what looks like giant footprints. The tombstone reads: &quot;To the
        Memory of the Memory of Lise Yeats.&quot; Plugging in the black box, they get the whole
        story...<p><b>Episode Quote:</b> &quot;All your ingredients are wrong, right? You're

      <dd>While exploring Kochanski's quarters, Lister happens upon a picture...a WEDDING picture,
        featuring Kochanski standing in between two men. He is one of those men! He doesn't
        remember taking this picture. Therefore, Lister thinks, he must go back in time. He
        remembers an episode back before the accident when Arnie &quot;hallucinated&quot; his own
        head coming up through a table and talking to him, telling him that there was a stasis
        leak on Floor Sixteen. It must have been Rimmer's hologram from the future! The boys head
        down to Floor Sixteen, and sure enough, there is a strange barrier that opens into the
        shower room of the Dwarf six weeks before the crew got wiped out. Rimmer runs off, intent
        on convincing himself to go into stasis, thereby saving his own life. (Apparently Rimmer
        doesn't remember what happens when there are two of him.) Lister finds out that Kochanski
        is on planet leave, and heads down to the Ganemede Holiday Inn to find her...already in
        the Honeymoon Suite...<p><b>Episode Quote:</b> &quot;If he's you and you're him, and

      <dd>Holly's mind seems to have been slipping lately; he keeps making mistakes, loses
        Rimmer's legs, and nearly kills Lister by electrocution. Lo and behold, a second computer
        personality rears itself: Queeg 500, the Red Dwarf backup computer. He's programmed to
        take over the ship if the primary computer endangers the crew. Holly is thereby demoted to
        night watchman, and Queeg takes over. The ship is put to rights--everything is cleaned,
        fixed, repaired, and running smoothly...except for one thing. Queeg runs exactly by the
        book, and forces the boys to work for their keep. Lister, Cat, and Rimmer don't
        particularly appreciate this, considering they get extremely little in return for so much
        work,; so they convince Holly to challenge Queeg for control. And so it boils down to a
        single game of chess for the fate of the crew....<p><b>Episode Quote:</b> &quot;If it's
        not serious when one's genitals go wandering off on their own, I'd like to know what

    <p><strong><a name="Parallel">Parallel Universe</a></strong><dl>
      <dd>This is the absolute funniest episode of Red Dwarf ever! This ep starts off with the
        music video &quot;Tongue Tied&quot; by The Cat, which, incidentally, was in the UK top 40
        when it first came out. (In the show, though, this whole sequence is a dream of the
        Cat's.)<p>Holly invents the &quot;Holly Hop Drive,&quot; which can transport the Dwarf to
        any other point in space instantaneously. The coordinates are set for Earth...only somehow
        the Dwarf ends up in a parallel universe. There is another Dwarf out there, exactly the
        same, except it has a female crew! Our boys go over to the other Dwarf and meet their
        female opposites: Deb Lister, Arlene Rimmer, Hilly, and Dog. So they all decide to go down
        to the disco for a drink while Holly and Hilly try to fix the Hop Drive. Deb and Dave
        spend the evening getting drunk, and Arlene attmepts to seduce Arnie, treating him the
        same way he treats women(as an alien species that needs to be conquered by trickery).
        Arnie ends up running away and hiding in fear once Arlene steps out to get some sexy
        videos. (She thought that seeing two men together might turn him on.)</p>
        <p>Next morning Dave wakes up in Arlene's bunk...next to Deb. He and Deb apparently had a
        drunken night of passion. Their talking is interrupted by the Rimmers walking in, and
        Arlene expresses her nasty desire that Lister gets pregnant. Not Deb Lister, mind you, but
        DAVE Lister. Apparently in their universe, it's the men who give birth to the babies. And
        as the boys are in the girls' universe, the latter's physical law applies. Dave Lister
        could be a mother! There's no time to lose, though, the boys have to get back to their
        Dwarf or they won't be able to use the Hop Drive. So Lister leaves the woman who could be
        the father of his children.</p>
        <p>Back on board his ship, Lister takes a &quot;Colour Pregnancy Test&quot;. Arnold
        remembers that picture from the future that mysteriously appeared while the Dwarf was
        travelling at light speed (see &quot;Future Echos&quot;) of Lister with two babies. Lister
        must have had twins! As Lister protests the test begins to change color...</p>

        uncle.&quot;</p>
